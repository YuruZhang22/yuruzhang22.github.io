I am a second-year Ph.D student and currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the [School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). My major is Computer Science and my research interests include Wireless Communication, Digital Twin, Machine Learning, Edge Computing.

Currently, I hold the position of Graduated Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Network sysTem (INT) Laboratory](https://liuqiang12040913.github.io/project.html) under the guidance of [Dr. Qiang Liu](https://liuqiang12040913.github.io/index.html). I received the M.Sc. degree in transportation information engineering and control from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, in 2022, and received the Outstanding Graduate Student Award.


Education
======
* Ph.D. student in Computer Science, University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, Aug. 2022 -- Present
* M.S. in Traffic Information Engineering and Control, Xidian University, Sept. 2019 -- June 2022
* B.E. in Communication Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China, Sept. 2015 -- June 2019

Experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant in University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Aug. 2023-Present
  * Research on digital twin in wireless communication. Proposed a new approach to build digital network twin by augmenting existing network simulators. Designed new deep learning methods (e.g., NeRF) to bridge simulation-to-reality discrepancy between simulators and reality.
  * Research on AI/ML-driven resource management in wireless network. Built an end-to-end 5G network testbed with Ettus USRP B210, OpenAirInterface 5G RAN and Open5GS Core. Designed Bayesian learning based algorithm to automate resource allocation in network slicing. Designed robust training approach to improve the robustness of AI/ML policies via adversarial attacking on state space and defense re-training.
